# Welcome!
Hi! GPT - 4U is a modern and security-focused interface for Large Language Models. I've included a host of features that I hope you enjoy. Feel free to use it, share it, modify it, and use it however you want (legally of course ðŸ˜˜). No need to attribute me or even ask for my permission. It's completely free!

Features:
- Pay as you use it, no need to pay an exorbitant fixed monthly fee.
- All your chat histories are stored in local text files. This means they can easily be moved, stored, or synced with your team via a plethora of cloud storage services. Think of the possibilities for team collaboration!
- Provides usage statistics.
